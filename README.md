# Motor Fault Detection using Machine Learning

This project focuses on **predictive maintenance for induction motors** using machine learning models.  
The dataset consists of three-phase current signature data of motors under **healthy** and **faulty** conditions (bearing faults and rotor bar faults).  
The goal is to build models that can accurately classify motor health conditions for industrial applications.

## üóÇÔ∏è Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes three-phase current signals collected under:
- **Healthy motor**
- **Bearing faults** (inner-race and outer-race, with different severity levels)
- **Broken rotor bar fault**
- Various load conditions (100W, 200W, 300W)

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: The dataset is **not included in this repository** due to size and usage constraints.
